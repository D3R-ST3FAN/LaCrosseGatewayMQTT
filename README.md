# LaCrosseGatewayMQTT
 LaCrosseGateway from FHEM with MQTT support added

Used board in my setup: Lolin D1 mini from ESP8266 Boards, version 3.0.2

The code has been taken from FHEM and MQTT support has just been added.
I.e. all the great stuff comes from the original developers of the gateway.
All the big thanks have to go to HCS and all the others.
